First Prize Winner at HackRiceX:

Uses Emotional AI (Affectiva API) to track aggregate student engagement/confusion in a live feedback system, then generates a post-class feedback with timestamps so that the instructor can go back in their Zoom recording and see how the class felt at each moment in the class.
